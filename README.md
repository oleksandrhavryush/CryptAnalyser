# Caesar Cipher Encryption: A Multilingual Text Encryption Tool

Embark on a journey of cryptography with the Caesar Cipher Encryption program. This Java-based application provides a robust solution for encrypting and decrypting text files using the Caesar cipher, a simple yet effective method of securing sensitive information. The program offers both a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI), catering to different user preferences.

## Project Overview

The project offers several key features:

- **Multilingual Support:** The program supports text encryption in multiple languages, including English and Ukrainian, making it versatile for a global user base.
- **Automatic Alphabet Detection:** The program automatically detects the alphabet used in the text (English or Ukrainian) and applies the appropriate encryption algorithm, ensuring accurate encryption and decryption.
- **CLI and GUI Interfaces:** Users can interact with the program using either a command-line interface or a graphical user interface, providing flexibility in usage.
- **Frequency Analysis:** The program includes a frequency analysis feature, which can be used to decrypt text without a key. This is particularly useful in situations where the key is unknown or lost.
- **Brute Force Decryption:** In addition to frequency analysis, the program also offers a brute force decryption option, which systematically tries all possible keys to find the correct decryption result.

## Setup and Configuration

### Prerequisites

- Java 1.8 or later
- A modern web browser

### Installation

1. **Clone the Project Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Open the Project:** Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
3. **Compile the Source Code:** Use a Java compiler to compile the source code.
4. **Run the Program:** Execute the `Main` class to start the application.

## Usage

1. **Access the Program:** Run the program from the command line or through its graphical user interface.
2. **Select an Operation:** Choose to encrypt or decrypt a text file.
3. **Input the Text File:** Provide the text file to be encrypted or decrypted.
4. **Specify the Key:** Enter the key to be used for encryption or decryption.
5. **View the Result:** The program will display the result of the encryption or decryption operation.

You can also run the program using a JAR file. To do this, open a command prompt or terminal window, navigate to the directory where the JAR file is located, and run the JAR file using the command `java -jar <JAR_FILE_NAME>`, replacing `<JAR_FILE_NAME>` with the name of the JAR file.

## Conclusion

The Caesar Cipher Encryption program showcases proficiency in Java and cryptography, offering a dynamic and interactive text encryption and decryption experience. Its user-friendly interface and robust functionality make it a valuable addition to any developer's portfolio.
