# Caesar Cipher Encryption Program

This Java-based program offers a robust solution for encrypting and decrypting text files using the Caesar cipher, a simple yet effective method of securing sensitive information. The program provides both a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI), allowing users to interact with the program in their preferred mode.

## Key Features

- **Multilingual Support**: The program supports text encryption in multiple languages, including English and Ukrainian.
- **Automatic Alphabet Detection**: The program can automatically detect the alphabet used in the text (English or Ukrainian) and apply the appropriate encryption algorithm.
- **CLI and GUI Interfaces**: Users can interact with the program using either a command-line interface or a graphical user interface, depending on their preference.
- **Frequency Analysis**: The program includes a frequency analysis feature, which can be used to decrypt text without a key. This is particularly useful in situations where the key is unknown or lost.
- **Brute Force Decryption**: In addition to frequency analysis, the program also offers a brute force decryption option, which systematically tries all possible keys to find the correct decryption result.

## How to Use
The program can be run from the command line or through its graphical user interface. To run the program, ensure that you have Java installed on your system, download the programâ€™s source code from GitHub, compile the source code using a Java compiler, and run the compiled program using the command `java Main`.

You can also run the program using a JAR file. To do this, open a command prompt or terminal window, navigate to the directory where the JAR file is located, and run the JAR file using the command `java -jar <JAR_FILE_NAME>`, replacing `<JAR_FILE_NAME>` with the name of the JAR file.

## Conclusion

This Caesar Cipher Encryption Program is a versatile tool for anyone needing to secure sensitive text information. With its multilingual support, automatic alphabet detection, and multiple decryption methods, it offers a comprehensive solution for text encryption and decryption.
